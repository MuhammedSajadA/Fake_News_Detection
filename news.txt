A massive fire in Rajasthan's Sariska Tiger Reserve that started yesterday has spread to over 10 sqkm, the size of some 1,800 football fields, officials have said. Two Indian Air Force, or IAF, helicopters are dropping water over the affected area, they said.
The fire threatens the territory of a tigress, codenamed ST-17 for tracking by scientists, which is at the area with her two cubs, officials have said. The big cats may suffocate, experts have said.

There are over 20 tigers in the Sariska reserve.

Firefighters are yet to bring the situation under control. The two IAF helicopters have been scooping up water from Rajasthan's Siliserh Lake and dropping over the forest fire in Sariska, 43 km from the lake.

Three villages near the tiger reserve have been put on alert as the fire didn't die down for over 24 hours due to windy conditions.

While the cause of the fire is not known, there has been an intense heat wave in the northern parts of the country in recent days.
